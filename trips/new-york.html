No Estado se localiza a cidade de Nova York, uma das maiores cidades e maior centro financeiro e comercial do mundo.</p>
<p>Escolher um alojamento dentro de Manhattan e, principalmente, perto de uma boa estação de metro, é uma dica que vale ouro para sua viagem.</p>
<p>As principais atrações de Nova York estão espalhadas pela ilha de Manhattan de norte a sul e de leste a oeste, ou seja, muitas estão em regiões completamente opostas uma das outras.</p>
<p>TRANSPORTES PÚBLICOS</p>
<p>O benefício do sistema OMNY é que o sistema reconhece o dono do cartão: basta usar o mesmo cartão doze vezes que a partir da décima terceira as viagens passam a ser gratuitas até o início da próxima semana (a contagem do sistema reinicia toda segunda-feira). Efetuar o registo em https://omny.info/.</p>
<p>Quando viajar de metro, é importante ter a noção geográfica dos pontos. Por exemplo se  está em Manhattan  e for para Brooklyn, está indo para downtown. Se uma linha vai para o Queens, ou Bronx, ela está indo para uptown.</p></div></div></article><article><div class="day-map" id="map-day-0"></div></article><div><article class="activity"><details id="poi-31803479-0-0" open="open"><summary class="expand-activity" data-activity="poi-31803479-0-0"><a class="mark-visited not-visited" href="#" id="poi-31803479-0-0-visited" data-activity="poi-31803479-0-0"><i class="material-icons small">visibility_off</i></a><strong class="activity-title"> Porto Airport</strong></summary><div><section><div class="md-content"><p>Código de reserva: KLENQ

<p>Although these needles are genuine Ancient Egyptian obelisks, their shared nickname is a misnomer, as they have no connection with the Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and were already over a thousand years old in her lifetime. The London and New York needles were originally made during the reign of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Thutmose III. An earlier reference states Queen Cleopatra brought the London obelisk from Heliopolis to Alexandria for the purpose of decorating a new temple but it was never erected and lay buried in sand on the shore until presented to Great Britain in 1819. The New York needle was the first to acquire the French nickname, "L'aiguille de Cléopâtre", when it stood in Alexandria.</p></div></section><section><kbd><small>Obelisk</small></kbd><kbd><small>Wheelchair Accessible</small></kbd><kbd><small>Historical</small></kbd><kbd><small>Artwork</small></kbd></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_on </i><span class="label">Coordenadas </span><div><small><a href="http://www.google.com/maps/place/40.7796358,-73.9653965">40.7796358, -73.9653965</a></small></div></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_city </i><span class="label">Morada </span><div><small>East Side at 81st Street,

It is even bigger than some countries (e.g. the Principality Monaco or the Vatican City State). Despite the fact that it was landscaped, it looks very natural. The park was opened for the public for the first time in 1858 and broadened to its present-day size in 1873.</p>
<p>Central Park is one of the most popular filming locations in New York City. Among many films that feature the Central Park is Breakfast at Tiffany’s, When Harry Met Sally or Home Alone 2: Lost in New York.</p>
<p>Among the many places worth visiting in Central Park are: the Belvedere Castle, the famous Strawberry Fields (a memorial dedicated to John Lennon) and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir.

It is much smaller than the iconic Central Park but it is a very cozy and nice place in the heart of Manhattan. Its history goes back to the 19th century when the first park occupying the present-day space was established. </p>
<p>It gets especially busy during the Christmas period when it turns into the Winter Village. There are little Christmas-themed shops and also a huge admission-free ice skating rink. </p>
<p>There are many interesting things to see in the park. The Reading Room located there is filled with books and magazines donated by the best-known publishing houses. Apart from the Reading Room, you can also admire the imposing Josephine Shaw Lowell Memorial Fountain or some of the beautiful statues (e.g. the statue of Gertrude Stein or Benito Juárez or the bust of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe).</p>
<p>You can find here many chargers where you can charge your phone for free and there is also free wifi.</p>

It got its name from the city’s nickname the "Empire State". For many years, it was the tallest building in the world (from 1931 to 1970) and even today it remains among the tallest buildings in the USA and in the world. </p>
<p>The Empire State Building's top floors offer spectacular views of the city (especially during the sunrise and the sunset). You can see all the important New York icons from there (e.g. Central Park, Chrysler Building or the Hudson River). Consider the weather before heading there, though, because it might affect your visit quite heavily.</p>
<p>The building appears in the King Kong film in its most iconic scene where the gigantic ape climbs it in order to escape its pursuers. Other well-known films that feature the Empire State Building are Sleepless in Seattle, When Harry Met Sally, and Independence Day. </p>
<p>If you want to avoid the long queues, you can buy your tickets online. </p>
<p>If you wish to get to the Empire State Building by the public transport, you can get there by subway (Lines B, D, F, V, N, Q, R, W, 6) or by PATH (rail system).</p></div></section><section><kbd><small>360° Content</small></kbd><kbd><small>Aerial Views</small></kbd><kbd><small>New York CityPass</small></kbd><kbd><small>Art Deco</small></kbd><kbd><small>Lookout</small></kbd><kbd><small>Skyscraper</small></kbd><kbd><small>Modern Architecture</small></kbd><kbd><small>Wheelchair Accessible</small></kbd><kbd><small>Filming Location</small></kbd><kbd><small>Office</small></kbd></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_on </i><span class="label">Coordenadas </span><div><small><a href="http://www.google.com/maps/place/40.7484312,-73.9856567">40.7484312, -73.9856567</a></small></div></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_city </i><span class="label">Morada </span><div><small>20 W 34th St, 10001 New York City, NY</small></div></section><section><i class="material-icons">attach_money</i><span class="label">Preço</span><div><small>Main deck (86th Floor) + 2nd Floor Museum:

<p>The museum offers three main exhibitions: The Historical one, divided into three sections, covering the day of the attacks, as well as the day before and the day after, the Memorial exhibition, dedicated to the victims of the attacks, and finally the Foundation Hall. In it, you can look at the last column and wall that remains of the Twins today.  </p>
<p>When visiting, keep in mind that the museum gets crowded during the weekends, so if you can, visit it on a workday. Since it is quite large, be careful to reserve enough time for exploring the museum. It may take an entire afternoon to walk through all the exhibits. It is not recommended to take children younger than 10 to the Historical exhibition.</p></div></section><section><kbd><small>Nine Eleven</small></kbd><kbd><small>New York CityPass</small></kbd><kbd><small>Museum</small></kbd><kbd><small>Wheelchair Accessible</small></kbd><kbd><small>History Museum</small></kbd></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_on </i><span class="label">Coordenadas </span><div><small><a href="http://www.google.com/maps/place/40.7114831,-74.0126849">40.7114831, -74.0126849</a></small></div></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_city </i><span class="label">Morada </span><div><small>180 Greenwich Street,

<p>Bom, como eu estava com o SightSeeing Pass e tinha flexibilidade para agendar o dia da minha visita, aproveitei uma manhã de sol e céu aberto para conhecer o observatório – se o tempo estiver fechado ou com nuvens baixas, você pode chegar lá e não ver absolutamente nada.</p>
<p>O dia estava realmente lindo, tanto que rendeu fotos incríveis da área do memorial e também da nova Estação Oculus – que ficam bem ao lado do prédio.</p>
<p>A entrada do observatório fica entre a esquina da West com a Vesey St. Chegando lá, você precisa apresentar o passe na bilheteria e pegar seu horário de entrada – é tudo extremamente organizado.</p>
<p>Para que dê tudo certo com a sua visita ao observatório do One World Trade Center, vou separar algumas dicas importantes:</p>
<p>Fique de olho na previsão do tempo: fazer a visita em um dia fechado ou com nevoeiro não vai proporcionar uma boa experiência. Normalmente a previsão do tempo em Nova York é muito certeira, então vale acompanhar;</p>
<p>Aproveite a flexibilidade dos passes: se você optar por comprar o ingresso do observatório, vai ter que se programar com antecedência. Já para quem usar o passe, como eu fiz, a flexibilidade de escolher o melhor dia é bem maior.</p>
<p>Evite levar muitas coisas com você: como comentei, a revista para acesso ao observatório é bem rigorosa – se você não gosta desses procedimentos, evite levar muita coisa.</p>
<p>Faça a visita no começo do dia ou no pôr do sol: a luz nesses horários são as melhores! Eu optei pelo início do dia, pois a previsão da tarde era de tempo fechado.</p>
<p>Fotos no observatório: esse observatório é totalmente fechado com vidros, então as fotos podem ter reflexo e não são muito ffáceis de tirar – nem pense em utilizar o flash.
Se você não for utilizar um passe de atrações e quiser comprar o seu ingresso, <a href="https://www.getyourguide.pt/s?partner_id=7R9GJVO&utm_medium=online_publisher&utm_source=um_viajante&placement=content-top&currency=USD&visitor-id=0GFS2GLTGHHPNUEUUVX9OB9IPZ3MSN1L&locale_autoredirect_optout=true&q=Nova%20Iorque&et=52132&lc=59">recomendo o site da GetYourGuide</a>.

Also called Freedom Tower, it is the tallest building in the U.S., as well as in the Western Hemisphere. </p>
<p>This tower, opened in 2013, is exactly 1776 feet (or 541 meters) tall. The height is meant to commemorate the year of signing the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>Since 2015, a World Trade Center Observatory is open on floors 100 - 102. Although it is placed at the height of "only" approximately 380 meters, it offers its visitors an unparalleled view of the panorama of the city below. You can even see into the distance of as far as a 50-kilometer radius.</p>
<p>The tower offers many places to sit and eat. You can also use the opportunity to listen to recordings on an iPad, which you can borrow here. Learn more about the architecture and history of the New York City through productions and signs, as you enjoy the view from the tallest building in New York.</p>
<p>Saindo da estação, você chegará ao Memorial e também o Museu do 11 de Setembro – que recomendo que faça parte do seu roteiro. Mas, antes da visita ao museu, sugiro que comece pelo Observatório do One World Trade Center – assim você evita o movimento mais tarde.</p>
<p>O Observatório do One World Trade Center é todo fechado com vidros, diferente do Top of the Rock, por exemplo. Nesse caso, indico que você visite o observatório no começo do dia e deixe os observatórios ao ar livre para o pôr do sol.</p>
<p>Já posso adiantar que a visita ao observatório valeu super a pena e é, sem dúvidas, uma atração que recomendo para sua viagem. Nesse post, quero dar um panorama geral de como é a visita e também passar algumas informações e dicas que podem tornar sua experiência ainda mais especial.</p>
<p>Com sua obra iniciada em abril de 2006, foi somente no dia 30 de abril de 2012 que o One World Trade Center tomou seu posto como a estrutura mais alta da cidade de Nova York – nesse dia, a construção ultrapassou a altura do Empire State Building.</p>
<p>Em maio de 2013 o arranha céu, até então chamado de Freedom Tower, chegou a sua altura máxima: 541 metros. Mas foi só em novembro de 2014 que o prédio foi oficialmente inaugurado e batizado com seu nome oficial: One World Trade Center.
Com 104 andares, ele não é só o prédio mais alto de Nova York como também o mais alto do ocidente – ficando em quarta posição na lista dos prédios mais altos do mundo.
Ao lado da construção você terá a oportunidade de visitar o memorial em homenagem às vítimas da tragédia e também o Museu do 11 de Setembro – uma visita difícil, mas extremamente importante.</p></div></section><section><kbd><small>360° Content</small></kbd><kbd><small>Aerial Views</small></kbd><kbd><small>Skyscraper</small></kbd><kbd><small>Observatory</small></kbd><kbd><small>Modern Architecture</small></kbd></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_on </i><span class="label">Coordenadas </span><div><small><a href="http://www.google.com/maps/place/40.7130013,-74.0131903">40.7130013, -74.0131903</a></small></div></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_city </i><span class="label">Morada </span><div><small>285 Fulton Street,

It was co-founded by Theodore Roosevelt Sr. (father of the 26th American president) and it covers more than 30 million specimens of plants, animals, meteorites etc. </p>
<p>Among the most interesting highlights of the museum are: a blue whale replica, the dinosaur skeletons, Lucy - a skeleton of one of our most ancient ancestors - or one of the Moai statues of Easter Island.</p>
<p>The American Museum of Natural History is quite close to the Metropolitan Museum of Art so if you want to visit both, you might do so on the same day. However, both museums are quite large so be prepared for lots of walking.</p>
<p>Even though the American Museum of Natural History is a popular sight, it is rarely crowded due to its size. It is air-conditioned which might be a pleasant feature on warm days and there is free wifi inside the complex. </p>
<p>If you are a fan of the film Night at the Museum (based on a book by Milan Trenc) you will surely enjoy the visit because it is here where the story takes place.</p>
<p>The general admission is only a suggested one so it is solely up to you how much money you want to spend on the ticket.</p></div></section><section><kbd><small>New York CityPass</small></kbd><kbd><small>Natural History Museum</small></kbd><kbd><small>Museum</small></kbd><kbd><small>IMAX</small></kbd><kbd><small>Wheelchair Accessible</small></kbd><kbd><small>Paid</small></kbd></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_on </i><span class="label">Coordenadas </span><div><small><a href="http://www.google.com/maps/place/40.7811534,-73.9740466">40.7811534, -73.9740466</a></small></div></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_city </i><span class="label">Morada </span><div><small>200 Central Park West (at 79th Street),

Built to plans by the British designer Thomas Heatherwick, the elaborate honeycomb-like structure rises 16 stories and consists of 154 flights of stairs, 2,500 steps, and 80 landings for visitors to climb. Vessel is the main feature of the 5-acre Hudson Yards Public Square. Funded by Hudson Yards developer Related Companies, its final cost is estimated at $200 million.</p>
<p>The concept of Vessel was unveiled to the public on September 14, 2016. Construction began in April 2017, with the pieces being manufactured in Italy and shipped to the United States. Vessel topped out in December 2017 with the installation of its highest piece, and it opened to the public on March 15, 2019.</p>
<p>Seguindo o passeio pelo High Line Park, você enfim chegará ao Hudson Yards: o complexo luxuoso onde está o mais novo cartão postal de Nova York: The Vessel.</p>
<p>É importante ressaltar que você só consegue visitar o The Vessel se agendar a visita. Como o seu roteiro é mais curto, recomendo fazer a reserva para o horário perto do almoço – pois é mais ou menos a hora em que você vai passar por ele nesse passeio.</p>
<p>Caso consiga encaixar em outro momento, uma boa pedida é subir no The Vessel no final da tarde – assim você curte o pôr do sol lá do alto.</p></div></section><section><kbd><small>Wheelchair Accessible</small></kbd><kbd><small>Sculpture</small></kbd><kbd><small>Artwork</small></kbd><kbd><small>Editor's Choice</small></kbd></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_on </i><span class="label">Coordenadas </span><div><small><a href="http://www.google.com/maps/place/40.7538056,-74.0021537">40.7538056, -74.0021537</a></small></div></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_city </i><span class="label">Morada </span><div><small>Manhattan 10001, United States</small></div></section></div></details></article></div><div><div class="transport"><div class="transport-left"><div class="transport-mode"><i class="material-icons">directions_transit</i></div></div><div class="transport-right"><div class="transport-info"><small>27 minutes, 50 seconds (2.52 km)</small></div></div></div></div><div><article class="activity"><details id="poi-14713-5-3" open="open"><summary class="expand-activity" data-activity="poi-14713-5-3"><a class="mark-visited not-visited" href="#" id="poi-14713-5-3-visited" data-activity="poi-14713-5-3"><i class="material-icons small">visibility_off</i></a><strong class="activity-title"> Flatiron Building</strong></summary><div><section><img src="https://media-cdn.sygictraveldata.com/media/1280x500/612664395a40232133447d33247d383434343234343439"/></section><section><div class="md-content"><p>The icon of New York (and one of its most often photographed skyscrapers) was not always known as the Flatiron Building. In 1902, when it was built for the Fuller Company, it was called the Fuller Building. The company only had its headquarters there till 1910 so the name eventually changed. </p>
<p>The area where the building is located (between the 22nd and 23rd Street) was already known as the "Flat Iron" and so the building got its name after the spot rather than after its shape. Nowadays though, the whole area is called the Flatiron District (after the building).</p>
<p>Sadly, it is not open to the public and there are no tours organised - the building is full of offices. Many publishing companies have their headquarters here (e.g. MacMillan Publishing). Still, it is definitely worth the trip because the Renaissance Revival building looks stunning even from the outside.</p></div></section><section><kbd><small>360° Content</small></kbd><kbd><small>Skyscraper</small></kbd><kbd><small>Modern Architecture</small></kbd><kbd><small>Neo-Renaissance Architecture</small></kbd><kbd><small>Office Building</small></kbd><kbd><small>Historic Building</small></kbd></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_on </i><span class="label">Coordenadas </span><div><small><a href="http://www.google.com/maps/place/40.7410023,-73.9896529">40.7410023, -73.9896529</a></small></div></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_city </i><span class="label">Morada </span><div><small>175 Fifth Avenue

No Estado se localiza a cidade de Nova York, uma das maiores cidades e maior centro financeiro e comercial do mundo.\n\nEscolher um alojamento dentro de Manhattan e, principalmente, perto de uma boa estação de metro, é uma dica que vale ouro para sua viagem.\n\nAs principais atrações de Nova York estão espalhadas pela ilha de Manhattan de norte a sul e de leste a oeste, ou seja, muitas estão em regiões completamente opostas uma das outras.\n\nTRANSPORTES PÚBLICOS\n\nO benefício do sistema OMNY é que o sistema reconhece o dono do cartão: basta usar o mesmo cartão doze vezes que a partir da décima terceira as viagens passam a ser gratuitas até o início da próxima semana (a contagem do sistema reinicia toda segunda-feira). Efetuar o registo em https://omny.info/.\n\n\nQuando viajar de metro, é importante ter a noção geográfica dos pontos. Por exemplo se  está em Manhattan  e for para Brooklyn, está indo para downtown. Se uma linha vai para o Queens, ou Bronx, ela está indo para uptown.","activities":[{"category":"activity","uid":"poi-31803479-0-0","title":"Porto Airport","description":"Código de reserva: KLENQ\nCompanhia: Iberia\nPreço do Avião (ida e volta): 968,80€\n\nPorto  >> Madrid\nHora de saída: 08:20\nHora de chegada: 10:40\nTerminal de chegada: 4\n\nMadrid >> Nova Iorque (JFK)\nHora da partida: 12:20\nHora de chegada: 14:35\nTerminal de partida: 4S\nTerminal de chegada: 8","price":null,"opening_hours":null,"duration":null,"address":null,"phone":null,"tags":[{"key":"Airport Terminal","name":"Airport Terminal"},{"key":"Wheelchair Accessible","name":"Wheelchair Accessible"}],"image":null,"coordinates":{"latitude":41.2366004,"longitude":-8.671307},"map_link":"http://www.google.com/maps/place/41.2366004,-8.671307","transport":null},{"category":"activity","uid":"poi-1865371-0-1","title":"JFK Terminal 8","description":null,"price":null,"opening_hours":null,"duration":null,"address":null,"phone":null,"tags":[{"key":"Airport Terminal","name":"Airport Terminal"}],"image":null,"coordinates":{"latitude":40.6479487,"longitude":-73.7913906},"map_link":"http://www.google.com/maps/place/40.6479487,-73.7913906","transport":null},{"category":"activity","uid":"c-63cc60f6d7ceb-0-2","title":"Apartamento","description":"Apartamento: [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.pt/trips/v1/1c872ea8-f9e7-41f6-8f0d-927b7c3b91a8/ro/RESERVATION2_CHECKIN/HMCWEDAPYD?_set_bev_on_new_domain=1674337524_NDk2ZmQ3NDY2MjIy)\n\nMorada:\n210 East 122nd Street, Nova Iorque, Nova Iorque 10035, Estados Unidos\n\nPreço: 897.85€","price":null,"opening_hours":null,"duration":null,"address":"212 East 122nd Street, Cidade de Nova Iorque, Nova Iorque","phone":null,"tags":[],"image":null,"coordinates":{"latitude":40.80148,"longitude":-73.93654},"map_link":"http://www.google.com/maps/place/40.80148,-73.93654","transport":{"notes":"Linha vermelha (AirTrain JFK Red - Jamaica - Airport )\n > Paragem inical: JFK Terminal 8-9\n > Paragem final: Jamaica Station (AirTrain) (2 paragens)\n\nLinha azul (E) \nParagem inicial: Sutphin Blvd - Archer Av - JFK Airp\nParagem final: Lexington Av/53 St (9 paragens)\n\nLinha verde (6)\nParagem inicial: 51 St\nParagem final: 125 St (9 paragens)\n\nWalk 5 min","recommended":{"mode":"car","duration":"31 minutes, 51 seconds","distance":"27.48 km"},"alternatives":[{"mode":"car","duration":"31 minutes, 51 seconds","distance":"27.48 km"},{"mode":"car","duration":"32 minutes, 41 seconds","distance":"28.20 km"},{"mode":"car","duration":"34 minutes, 29 seconds","distance":"29.21 km"}]}}]},{"date":"2023-04-23T23:00:00.000Z","description":null,"activities":[{"category":"activity","uid":"c-63cc60f6d7ceb-1-0","title":"Apartamento","description":null,"price":null,"opening_hours":null,"duration":null,"address":"212 East 122nd Street, Cidade de Nova Iorque, Nova Iorque","phone":null,"tags":[],"image":null,"coordinates":{"latitude":40.80148,"longitude":-73.93654},"map_link":"http://www.google.com/maps/place/40.80148,-73.93654","transport":null},{"category":"activity","uid":"c-63e0194daec11-1-1","title":"Samsung","description":null,"price":null,"opening_hours":null,"duration":null,"address":"841 Washington Street, Cidade de Nova Iorque, Nova Iorque","phone":null,"tags":[],"image":null,"coordinates":{"latitude":40.74074,"longitude":-74.0076},"map_link":"http://www.google.com/maps/place/40.74074,-74.0076","transport":{"notes":null,"recommended":{"mode":"car","duration":"14 minutes, 30 seconds","distance":"13.91 km"},"alternatives":[{"mode":"car","duration":"14 minutes, 30 seconds","distance":"13.91 km"},{"mode":"car","duration":"14 minutes, 37 seconds","distance":"13.01 km"},{"mode":"car","duration":"15 minutes, 5 seconds","distance":"12.66 km"}]}},{"category":"activity","uid":"poi-34979-1-2","title":"Ghostbusters Building","description":"Predominantly known as the \"Spook Central\", Ghostbuster fans will surely recognize it within seconds.

Also called Freedom Tower, it is the tallest building in the U.S., as well as in the Western Hemisphere. \n\nThis tower, opened in 2013, is exactly 1776 feet (or 541 meters) tall. The height is meant to commemorate the year of signing the Declaration of Independence.\n\nSince 2015, a World Trade Center Observatory is open on floors 100 - 102. Although it is placed at the height of \"only\" approximately 380 meters, it offers its visitors an unparalleled view of the panorama of the city below. You can even see into the distance of as far as a 50-kilometer radius.\n\nThe tower offers many places to sit and eat. You can also use the opportunity to listen to recordings on an iPad, which you can borrow here. Learn more about the architecture and history of the New York City through productions and signs, as you enjoy the view from the tallest building in New York.\n\nSaindo da estação, você chegará ao Memorial e também o Museu do 11 de Setembro – que recomendo que faça parte do seu roteiro. Mas, antes da visita ao museu, sugiro que comece pelo Observatório do One World Trade Center – assim você evita o movimento mais tarde.\n\nO Observatório do One World Trade Center é todo fechado com vidros, diferente do Top of the Rock, por exemplo. Nesse caso, indico que você visite o observatório no começo do dia e deixe os observatórios ao ar livre para o pôr do sol.\n\nJá posso adiantar que a visita ao observatório valeu super a pena e é, sem dúvidas, uma atração que recomendo para sua viagem. Nesse post, quero dar um panorama geral de como é a visita e também passar algumas informações e dicas que podem tornar sua experiência ainda mais especial.\n\nCom sua obra iniciada em abril de 2006, foi somente no dia 30 de abril de 2012 que o One World Trade Center tomou seu posto como a estrutura mais alta da cidade de Nova York – nesse dia, a construção ultrapassou a altura do Empire State Building.\n\nEm maio de 2013 o arranha céu, até então chamado de Freedom Tower, chegou a sua altura máxima: 541 metros. Mas foi só em novembro de 2014 que o prédio foi oficialmente inaugurado e batizado com seu nome oficial: One World Trade Center.\nCom 104 andares, ele não é só o prédio mais alto de Nova York como também o mais alto do ocidente – ficando em quarta posição na lista dos prédios mais altos do mundo.\nAo lado da construção você terá a oportunidade de visitar o memorial em homenagem às vítimas da tragédia e também o Museu do 11 de Setembro – uma visita difícil, mas extremamente importante.","price":"Adult: $35\nSenior: $33\nChild: $29\nChild (under 5): Free","opening_hours":null,"duration":null,"address":"285 Fulton Street,\nNew York, NY 10007, USA","phone":"+1 844 696 1776","tags":[{"key":"360° Content","name":"360° Content"},{"key":"Aerial Views","name":"Aerial Views"},{"key":"Skyscraper","name":"Skyscraper"},{"key":"Observatory","name":"Observatory"},{"key":"Modern Architecture","name":"Modern Architecture"}],"image":"https://media-cdn.sygictraveldata.com/media/1280x500/612664395a40232133447d33247d383434343236333732","coordinates":{"latitude":40.7130013,"longitude":-74.0131903},"map_link":"http://www.google.com/maps/place/40.7130013,-74.0131903","transport":{"notes":null,"recommended":{"mode":"pedestrian","duration":"1 minute, 8 seconds","distance":"98 m"},"alternatives":[{"mode":"pedestrian","duration":"1 minute, 8 seconds","distance":"98 m"}]}},{"category":"activity","uid":"poi-11872-4-6","title":"Broadway","description":"The 21 km long street in Manhattan is best known as the location of many New York theatres.
