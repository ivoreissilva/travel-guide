Cidade histórica de
França, desenhada nas margens do Sena, foi palco de
grandes revoluções que marcaram a História do Mundo. Ao mesmo
tempo guarda segredos de arte, religião, cultura, gastronomia e moda, que
só o visitante mais apaixonado consegue descobrir.
Deleite-se com a verdadeira cidade da luz.</p>
<p>As longas avenidas rodeadas de árvores, as pontes, os candeeiros de ferro, os cafés com esplanadas aquecidas, os prédios nunca demasiado altos, a Torre Eiffel iluminada, os museus e os monumentos mais conhecidos do Mundo e os crepes de chocolate na rua. Isto é Paris, mas não só. Ao mesmo tempo que tudo lhe possa parecer familiar, a cidade está em constante renovação
e crescimento, ainda que de forma regulada, associada sempre a um delicado bom senso, a que se pode chamar elegância. É isso. Elegância. Nenhuma outra palavra descreve melhor a aura de Paris, sendo essa elegância que apaixona qualquer visitante, em qualquer altura do ano.</p>

<p>The museum is very large, covers nearly all epochs of human history (except for modern art) and seeing all of its parts can be both exhausting and time-consuming. The multilingual maps provided in the museum for free might prove handy while picking the best route that would include all of the things that interest you (e.g Greek Antiquities, Pharaonic Egypt, Renaissance Art, Large-Format Paintings, Napoleon III Apartments etc.).</p>

<p>Although it is one of the world's most visited tourist attractions now, it was not accepted well by the French at the time. Also, it was supposed to be taken down after 20 years since it was meant to be only a temporary exhibit. Fortunately, Gustave Eiffel convinced the government to keep the construction and use it as a radiotelegraph station.</p>
<p>There are 1,665 steps leading to the top, but you can take the stairs only to the second floor. A lift takes you to the top floor. Originally, only the second floor was open to the public, but now all three levels are accessible and boast award-winning restaurants. In the evening, Eiffel Tower is illuminated with 20,000 light bulbs.</p>
<p>Please note that there are no locker rooms, so do not bring large baggage or pushchairs if you cannot fold them. </p>
<p>In 2017, it was announced that the metal fence surrounding the Eiffel Tower will be replaced by a wall of bulletproof glass as protection against terror attacks.</p></div></section><section><kbd><small>360° Content</small></kbd><kbd><small>Observation Tower</small></kbd><kbd><small>World's Fair Architecture</small></kbd><kbd><small>Scenic Lookout</small></kbd><kbd><small>Wheelchair Accessible</small></kbd><kbd><small>View Point</small></kbd><kbd><small>Regional Heritage</small></kbd><kbd><small>Heritage</small></kbd><kbd><small>Tower</small></kbd></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_on </i><span class="label">Coordenadas </span><div><small><a href="http://www.google.com/maps/place/48.8582619,2.2944955">48.8582619, 2.2944955</a></small></div></section><section><i class="material-icons">location_city </i><span class="label">Morada </span><div><small>Champ de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007 Paris, France</small></div></section><section><i class="material-icons">attach_money</i><span class="label">Preço</span><div><small>Lift entrance ticket* / to the top / by stairs*/ stair access + lift
